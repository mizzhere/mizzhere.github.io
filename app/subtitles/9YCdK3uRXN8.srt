1
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,123
Good evening.

2
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,081
Queen Victoria once said
"We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat;

3
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:29,085
it does not exist."

4
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:32,482
Queen Victoria would have loved Only Connect.

5
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:36,447
And like many of our viewers,
she would not have found these intros amusing.

6
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:39,364
Joining me for this quarter-final on my right:

7
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:44,729
Alexia Jarvis, who had her first cheese sandwich aged 30.

8
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,763
Jonathan Gibson, who can play Sweet Child o' Mine on the ukulele.

9
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:51,201
And their captain, Paddy Pamment...

10
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:55,768
...who has archived a hundred Charlton Athletic away match ticket stubs.

11
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:59,445
United by high balls and curveballs, they are the Pitchers.

12
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:03,167
Paddy, if I said "Surprise! We've changed the format...

13
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,042
...from the quarter-finals on, this is not a quiz but a talent contest,"
what would you do?

14
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:10,041
Oh my word. Um...

15
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:14,446
I have one thing in the back pocket
and that's a Michael McIntyre impression.

16
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,249
Either that or piano.

17
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,203
Well, we don't have a piano here. So...

18
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:25,928
If you were Michael McIntyre and I asked if you were looking forward to tonight's show,
you would say...?

19
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:28,405
Well, this is my favorite quiz show of them all, Victoria!

20
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,362
Thank you so much for having me, darling!

21
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:33,887
Hello, hello, hello!

22
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,764
That's really good!

23
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:37,289
That's a really good impression.

24
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:38,963
Very well done.

25
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:42,326
Well, the stakes are going to be high for your opponents, who are...

26
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:43,489
...on my left.

27
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:47,125
Raphael Kabo, who built his own lightsaber.

28
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:51,568
Carolina Cordero,
who dropped a clipboard into a hundred-year-old church organ.

29
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,403
And their captain, Emily Bourke...

30
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:56,887
...who failed to recognize Leonard Cohen in a Chinese restaurant.

31
00:01:56,887 --> 00:02:02,124
Combined by conquering quests and characters, they are the Sorcerers.

32
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:04,409
Now, what about you, Emily? If this was suddenly...

33
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,882
...I'm not going to make you do an impression,
but if this was suddenly Britain's Got Talent...

34
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,247
...what would you pull out the bag?

35
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:12,123
I think it would be, yeah, either bassoon or singing.

36
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:14,248
What's your party piece? What would you play?

37
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:17,445
It's not interesting. There is a lovely Telemann sonata in F minor.

38
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:19,642
That absolutely IS interesting.

39
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:22,489
Some of our viewers are intellectuals, you know.

40
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,245
Not *you* obviously, but some people.

41
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,608
Lovely.

42
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:30,682
Nevertheless, we have not changed the format. We *are* going to play a quiz.

43
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,005
Pitchers, you won the toss, you'll be going first.

44
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,928
Please choose an Egyptian hieroglyph.

45
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:36,443
Uh, Eye of Horus, please.

46
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:39,089
Eye of Horus will be the first question of the game.

47
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,204
What do these clues have in common? Here's the first.

48
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:48,007
- It could be the same thing.
- Oh yeah.
- We'll need more though.

49
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,365
Next, please.

50
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:52,928
Directions of electromagnetic forces.

51
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,763
North or south? Polar or non-polar?

52
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:57,809
Maybe. But then what's the bread and drink? We need more, right?

53
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,324
Next, please.

54
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:02,367
Nine times table (first ten multiples).

55
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,482
Oh, it's what you do with your finger.

56
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,009
Are you sure you do it with your fingers?

57
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,765
Well yeah, I mean the reverse, yeah.

58
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:10,248
They're reverse... 'cause it's like 54, 45...

59
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,563
Do we want the last one?

60
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:12,689
Yeah, I think so.

61
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:14,442
Next, please.

62
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:16,287
Opposites.

63
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:17,449
Shall we say opposites?

64
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,205
Yeah, like mirrored...

65
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:24,321
These are opposites or mirrored images.

66
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:27,764
I think that might apply to some of them, but not all of the clues.

67
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:30,883
So that's not it. Sorcerers, you've got the chance of a bonus point.

68
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:33,729
There are hand rules for remembering these things.

69
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,441
They all feature in mnemonics involving the hands.

70
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,487
What clues can you tell me about?

71
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:41,202
So there's a, I think, a right-hand rule
for directions of electromagnetic forces?

72
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:43,485
Yes, that one's quite complicated to explain.

73
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:46,249
You make an L with your left hand, so that's how you know it's your left.

74
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,324
Left and right, like this.

75
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:49,761
And I don't know the other two.

76
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,683
The nine times table... I've forgotten how you do it,
but you do the entire nine times table on your fingers.

77
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:56,128
You can! So what you do... Starting on the left, and viewers...

78
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,685
...although I'm not good with left and right, but this is my left...

79
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:02,122
...you bend down the finger you want to multiply by nine.

80
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:05,487
So for example four. One, two, three, four. You bend that down.

81
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:08,721
And on one side you've got the tens and the other side the digits.

82
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:12,129
So one, two, three... 30. One, two, three, four, five, six... 36.

83
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,285
Is four times nine.

84
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,082
Oh, I love that.

85
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:18,527
And the bread and drink, you do that, and one is B and one is D.

86
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:22,049
Laying the table suddenly got a lot easier, didn't it?

87
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,762
Assuming we all do formal dining.

88
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,603
So you get the bonus point and what will your own question be?

89
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:28,407
Twisted Flax, please.

90
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,369
Twisted Flax.

91
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:33,761
A music question. What do they have in common? Here's the first.

92
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:39,365
[Music: I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago.]

93
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,482
[Music: And he told me he was single and we headed off right away...]

94
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,727
[Music: So we started living together.]

95
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:45,409
Next.

96
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:49,324
[Music: Oh no! You got it all wrong!]

97
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,402
Next.

98
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:59,685
[Music: I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint.
I'm number one.]

99
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,843
That's Annie Get Your Gun.

100
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,408
[Music: But my score with a feller is lower than a cellar.]

101
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,241
Next.

102
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,886
[Music: Will come out tomorrow. So you gotta hang on...]

103
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:13,249
[Music: ...to tomorrow.]

104
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,768
Are these musicals or songs with women's names in the title?

105
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:19,842
They are not.

106
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:22,247
So bonus chance for you now, Pitchers.

107
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,201
All sung by Annies.

108
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,926
They are all sung by Annies.

109
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,603
That last one, the musical "Annie". What was the third one?

110
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:31,448
That was "Annie Get Your Gun".

111
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,802
That's right, I think that must have been Doris Day singing that.

112
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:38,569
"Chicago" at clue one, and that's Annie who poisoned her husband.

113
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,245
And clue two...

114
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:45,321
...that's not a musical at all.
That's in fact the singer Annie with a single called "Chewing Gum".

115
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:48,723
What would you like, Pitchers, for your own question?

116
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,006
Uh, Two Reeds.

117
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,009
Two Reeds.

118
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,442
What connects these clues? Here's the first.

119
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:57,201
Rebus: learn new skills.

120
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:00,326
It's a type of cryptogram, isn't it, a rebus? Learn new skills.

121
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,043
It's also a detective.

122
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:03,168
That's true.

123
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:04,524
Next, please.

124
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,009
Resbus: hold back.

125
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,805
Sob... Sub... Su-bus... Going backwards?

126
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:12,127
We need more to puzzle it out, I think.

127
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,241
Yeah. Next, please.

128
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,362
Do we need to replace bus with something?

129
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:19,209
Oh yes. Reserve?

130
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,563
Relearn... Reserve...

131
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:22,886
Was it train?

132
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,249
If you change bus to train?

133
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,601
Retrain, restrain...

134
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,087
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bus to train.

135
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,283
Very good. Ah, I see.

136
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:33,088
Change bus to train and you 
get these words and their definitions.

137
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,841
Exactly so.

138
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:38,446
It's a train replacement bus service.

139
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,969
Please talk me through the clues, what would those words be?

140
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,443
Retrain, to learn new skills, in clue one.

141
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,567
We have restrain, to hold back.

142
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,092
Contraindication.

143
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,809
That's clever, isn't it? Contrainedication.

144
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:56,004
And you didn't need to see "Untrained",
not having been taught particular skills.

145
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:56,801
Well done.

146
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:56,447
Sorcerers, what's next?

147
00:06:57,947 --> 00:06:57,482
Water, please.

148
00:06:58,882 --> 00:06:59,649
Water. These are gonna be picture clues.

149
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,884
What do they have in common? Here's the first.

150
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:07,442
A car crash. A serious accident.

151
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:08,726
Let's do next.

152
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,849
Next.

153
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:12,685
Tide? Tide pod?

154
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:14,486
A tab.

155
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:16,281
The tabs... Power...

156
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,169
Next.

157
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,882
That's The Edge. The Edge from U2.

158
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,126
Next.

159
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,608
A gauntlet.

160
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,041
Keys on a keyboard.

161
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,248
Not it.

162
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,042
Pitchers, another bonus chance.

163
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:45,649
Are these all lines?

164
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,406
I'm afraid not.

165
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:51,058
That first clue, it's a still from a TV program called "Collision".

166
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:56,483
We've got Collision, Powerball, The Edge of course, and Gauntlet.

167
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:59,361
They are games on Gladiators.

168
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:02,806
The reincarnated Gladiators show.

169
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:06,249
Pitchers, there's one choice left. What will it be?

170
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,045
The Lion, please Victoria.

171
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,328
Lion. What do these clues have in common? Here's the first.

172
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,329
Turkey? No, Austrian flag.

173
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,684
Vienna.

174
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,448
Is it capital?

175
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,603
Vienna... Queen of Africa...

176
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:20,809
Next, please.

177
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,886
Nigeria and outside?

178
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,609
Green... Green something...

179
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:28,404
Oh, is it Penguin?

180
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:31,048
It is... Like the Penguin book coloring?

181
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:33,523
African Penguin, Little Penguin... those are both penguins.

182
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:34,889
Is it just penguins?

183
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,445
You can bail me out if I get it wrong mate.

184
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,129
Penguins.

185
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,484
Um, in so far as African Penguin, Little Penguin,
and these are the color schemes for Penguin Books with those genres.

186
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:47,728
That is exactly right! And well done,
you get three points for coming in after two clues.

187
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:52,965
So that first series of Penguin books released...
Originally I think they were black and white...

188
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,769
...but they had a color block to show genre.

189
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,768
We are combining actual penguins with Penguin Books.

190
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:02,123
Sorcerers, one question left.

191
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,369
The Horned Viper.

192
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:06,124
What do these clues have in common? Here's the first.

193
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,723
Love perhaps...

194
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,127
Amazing?

195
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:15,368
Must be nothing.

196
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:16,281
Next.

197
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,283
Malted milk drink.

198
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,128
Ovaltine?

199
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,364
Horlicks?

200
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,569
Milo?

201
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:25,129
Next.

202
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,088
Tamagotchi or Neopets?

203
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:30,123
Tamagotchi.

204
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,803
Is there another virtual pet I don't know?

205
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:34,729
Next.

206
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,567
Oh, that's the... um...

207
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,562
...the Eames chair? No that's a different one.

208
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:43,443
Is it egg?

209
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,608
Are they all egg related?

210
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:45,563
Egg chair?

211
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,964
Related by eggs.

212
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,288
They are connected by eggs.

213
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:52,962
What can you tell me about the clues?

214
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:56,368
Love could be zero as in an... an egg?

215
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:58,041
That's right. People say that...

216
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,806
...love in tennis comes from "l'oeuf". We don't know that.

217
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,247
But one of the theories is that it's "l'oeuf",
but also of course that the zero resembles an egg.

218
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,083
What's that second clue?

219
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,809
Ovaltine... we don't know actually.

220
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,084
I mean Ovaltine's an oval.

221
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:14,249
Well, but it's Ovaltine because of the "ovo", the Latin for egg...

222
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,765
...combined with malt and the other ingredients.

223
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:18,241
What's the virtual pet?

224
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,166
Tamagotchi.

225
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,522
Tamagotchi.

226
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:24,807
And "tamago" is the Japanese for egg.
It originally meant "egg watch" because it was a watch.

227
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,283
And the Arne Jacobsen chair, of course, the Egg Chair.

228
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,248
Well done.

229
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:31,442
That means at the end of Round One, the Sorcerers have 2 points...

230
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,767
...the Pitchers have 6.
