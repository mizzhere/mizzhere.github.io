1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,160
Good evening.

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,080
Queen Victoria once said
"We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat;

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,080
it does not exist."

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,480
Queen Victoria would have loved Only Connect.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,440
And like many of our viewers,
she would not have found these intros amusing.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,360
Joining me for this quarter-final on my right:

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,720
Alexia Jarvis, who had her first cheese sandwich aged 30.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,760
Jonathan Gibson, who can play Sweet Child o' Mine on the ukulele.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,200
And their captain, Paddy Pamment...

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,760
...who has archived a hundred Charlton Athletic away match ticket stubs.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,440
United by high balls and curveballs, they are the Pitchers.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,160
Paddy, if I said "Surprise! We've changed the format...

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,040
...from the quarter-finals on, this is not a quiz but a talent contest,"
what would you do?

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,040
Oh my word. Um...

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,440
I have one thing in the back pocket
and that's a Michael McIntyre impression.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,240
Either that or piano.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,200
Well, we don't have a piano here. So...

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,920
If you were Michael McIntyre and I asked if you were looking forward to tonight's show,
you would say...?

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Well, this is my favorite quiz show of them all, Victoria!

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,360
Thank you so much for having me, darling!

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,880
Hello, hello, hello!

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,760
That's really good!

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,280
That's a really good impression.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,960
Very well done.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,320
Well, the stakes are going to be high for your opponents, who are...

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,480
...on my left.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,120
Raphael Kabo, who built his own lightsaber.

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,560
Carolina Cordero,
who dropped a clipboard into a hundred-year-old church organ.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,400
And their captain, Emily Bourke...

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,880
...who failed to recognize Leonard Cohen in a Chinese restaurant.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,120
Combined by conquering quests and characters, they are the Sorcerers.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,400
Now, what about you, Emily? If this was suddenly...

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,880
...I'm not going to make you do an impression,
but if this was suddenly Britain's Got Talent...

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,240
...what would you pull out the bag?

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,120
I think it would be, yeah, either bassoon or singing.

36
00:02:12,120 -> 00:02:14,240
What's your party piece? What would you play?

37
00:02:14,240 -> 00:02:17,440
It's not interesting. There is a lovely Telemann sonata in F minor.

38
00:02:17,440 -> 00:02:19,640
That absolutely IS interesting.

39
00:02:19,640 -> 00:02:22,480
Some of our viewers are intellectuals, you know.

40
00:02:22,480 -> 00:02:24,240
Not you obviously, but some people.

41
00:02:25,560 -> 00:02:26,600
Lovely.

42
00:02:26,600 -> 00:02:30,680
Nevertheless, we have not changed the format. We are going to play a quiz.

43
00:02:30,680 -> 00:02:33,00:0
Pitchers, you won the toss, you'll be going first.

44
00:02:33,00:0 -> 00:02:34,920
Please choose an Egyptian hieroglyph.

45
00:02:34,920 -> 00:02:36,440
Uh, Eye of Horus, please.

46
00:02:36,440 -> 00:02:39,080
Eye of Horus will be the first question of the game.

47
00:02:39,080 -> 00:02:42,200
What do these clues have in common? Here's the first.

48
00:02:45,400 -> 00:02:48,00:0

It could be the same thing.

Oh yeah.

We'll need more though.

49
00:02:48,00:0 -> 00:02:49,360
Next, please.

50
00:02:51,520 -> 00:02:52,920
Directions of electromagnetic forces.

51
00:02:52,920 -> 00:02:54,760
North or south? Polar or non-polar?

52
00:02:54,760 -> 00:02:57,800
Maybe. But then what's the bread and drink? We need more, right?

53
00:02:57,800 -> 00:02:59,320
Next, please.

54
00:03:00,560 -> 00:03:02,360
Nine times table (first ten multiples).

55
00:03:02,360 -> 00:03:04,480
Oh, it's what you do with your finger.

56
00:03:04,480 -> 00:03:06,00:0
Are you sure you do it with your fingers?

57
00:03:06,00:0 -> 00:03:07,760
Well yeah, I mean the reverse, yeah.

58
00:03:07,760 -> 00:03:10,240
They're reverse... 'cause it's like 54, 45...

59
00:03:10,240 -> 00:03:11,560
Do we want the last one?

60
00:03:11,560 -> 00:03:12,680
Yeah, I think so.

61
00:03:12,680 -> 00:03:14,440
Next, please.

62
00:03:14,440 -> 00:03:16,280
Opposites.

63
00:03:16,280 -> 00:03:17,440
Shall we say opposites?

64
00:03:17,440 -> 00:03:19,200
Yeah, like mirrored...

65
00:03:21,520 -> 00:03:24,320
These are opposites or mirrored images.

66
00:03:24,320 -> 00:03:27,760
I think that might apply to some of them, but not all of the clues.

67
00:03:27,760 -> 00:03:30,880
So that's not it. Sorcerers, you've got the chance of a bonus point.

68
00:03:30,880 -> 00:03:33,720
There are hand rules for remembering these things.

69
00:03:33,720 -> 00:03:36,440
They all feature in mnemonics involving the hands.

70
00:03:36,440 -> 00:03:38,480
What clues can you tell me about?

71
00:03:38,480 -> 00:03:41,200
So there's a, I think, a right-hand rule
for directions of electromagnetic forces?

72
00:03:41,200 -> 00:03:43,480
Yes, that one's quite complicated to explain.

73
00:03:43,480 -> 00:03:46,240
You make an L with your left hand, so that's how you know it's your left.

74
00:03:46,240 -> 00:03:48,320
Left and right, like this.

75
00:03:48,320 -> 00:03:49,760
And I don't know the other two.

76
00:03:49,760 -> 00:03:52,680
The nine times table... I've forgotten how you do it,
but you do the entire nine times table on your fingers.

77
00:03:52,680 -> 00:03:56,120
You can! So what you do... Starting on the left, and viewers...

78
00:03:56,120 -> 00:03:58,680
...although I'm not good with left and right, but this is my left...

79
00:03:58,680 -> 00:04:02,120
...you bend down the finger you want to multiply by nine.

80
00:04:02,120 -> 00:04:05,480
So for example four. One, two, three, four. You bend that down.

81
00:04:05,480 -> 00:04:08,720
And on one side you've got the tens and the other side the digits.

82
00:04:08,720 -> 00:04:12,120
So one, two, three... 30. One, two, three, four, five, six... 36.

83
00:04:12,120 -> 00:04:13,280
Is four times nine.

84
00:04:13,280 -> 00:04:15,080
Oh, I love that.

85
00:04:15,080 -> 00:04:18,520
And the bread and drink, you do that, and one is B and one is D.

86
00:04:19,200 -> 00:04:22,040
Laying the table suddenly got a lot easier, didn't it?

87
00:04:22,040 -> 00:04:23,760
Assuming we all do formal dining.

88
00:04:24,200 -> 00:04:26,600
So you get the bonus point and what will your own question be?

89
00:04:26,600 -> 00:04:28,400
Twisted Flax, please.

90
00:04:28,400 -> 00:04:30,360
Twisted Flax.

91
00:04:30,840 -> 00:04:33,760
A music question. What do they have in common? Here's the first.

92
00:04:36,440 -> 00:04:39,360
[Music: I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago.]

93
00:04:39,360 -> 00:04:42,480
[Music: And he told me he was single and we headed off right away...]

94
00:04:42,480 -> 00:04:44,720
[Music: So we started living together.]

95
00:04:44,720 -> 00:04:45,400
Next.

96
00:04:45,400 -> 00:04:49,320
[Music: Oh no! You got it all wrong!]

97
00:04:52,960 -> 00:04:54,400
Next.

98
00:04:54,400 -> 00:04:59,680
[Music: I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint.
I'm number one.]

99
00:04:59,680 -> 00:05:01,840
That's Annie Get Your Gun.

100
00:05:01,840 -> 00:05:04,400
[Music: But my score with a feller is lower than a cellar.]

101
00:05:04,400 -> 00:05:06,240
Next.

102
00:05:06,240 -> 00:05:09,880
[Music: Will come out tomorrow. So you gotta hang on...]

103
00:05:09,880 -> 00:05:13,240
[Music: ...to tomorrow.]

104
00:05:15,640 -> 00:05:17,760
Are these musicals or songs with women's names in the title?

105
00:05:18,520 -> 00:05:19,840
They are not.

106
00:05:19,840 -> 00:05:22,240
So bonus chance for you now, Pitchers.

107
00:05:22,240 -> 00:05:24,200
All sung by Annies.

108
00:05:24,200 -> 00:05:25,920
They are all sung by Annies.

109
00:05:25,920 -> 00:05:29,600
That last one, the musical "Annie". What was the third one?

110
00:05:29,600 -> 00:05:31,440
That was "Annie Get Your Gun".

111
00:05:31,440 -> 00:05:34,800
That's right, I think that must have been Doris Day singing that.

112
00:05:34,800 -> 00:05:38,560
"Chicago" at clue one, and that's Annie who poisoned her husband.

113
00:05:38,560 -> 00:05:40,240
And clue two...

114
00:05:40,240 -> 00:05:45,320
...that's not a musical at all.
That's in fact the singer Annie with a single called "Chewing Gum".

115
00:05:46,280 -> 00:05:48,720
What would you like, Pitchers, for your own question?

116
00:05:48,720 -> 00:05:50,00:0
Uh, Two Reeds.

117
00:05:50,00:0 -> 00:05:51,00:0
Two Reeds.

118
00:05:51,00:0 -> 00:05:53,440
What connects these clues? Here's the first.

119
00:05:55,200 -> 00:05:57,200
Rebus: learn new skills.

120
00:05:57,200 -> 00:06:00,320
It's a type of cryptogram, isn't it, a rebus? Learn new skills.

121
00:06:00,320 -> 00:06:02,040
It's also a detective.

122
00:06:02,040 -> 00:06:03,160
That's true.

123
00:06:03,160 -> 00:06:04,520
Next, please.

124
00:06:04,520 -> 00:06:06,00:0
Resbus: hold back.

125
00:06:06,00:0 -> 00:06:09,800
Sob... Sub... Su-bus... Going backwards?

126
00:06:09,800 -> 00:06:12,120
We need more to puzzle it out, I think.

127
00:06:12,120 -> 00:06:13,240
Yeah. Next, please.

128
00:06:15,640 -> 00:06:17,360
Do we need to replace bus with something?

129
00:06:17,360 -> 00:06:19,200
Oh yes. Reserve?

130
00:06:19,200 -> 00:06:21,560
Relearn... Reserve...

131
00:06:21,560 -> 00:06:22,880
Was it train?

132
00:06:22,880 -> 00:06:24,240
If you change bus to train?

133
00:06:24,240 -> 00:06:26,600
Retrain, restrain...

134
00:06:26,600 -> 00:06:28,080

Yeah.

Yeah, bus to train.

135
00:06:28,080 -> 00:06:29,280
Very good. Ah, I see.

136
00:06:30,240 -> 00:06:33,080
Change bus to train and you get these words and their definitions.

137
00:06:33,080 -> 00:06:34,840
Exactly so.

138
00:06:34,840 -> 00:06:37,440
It's a train replacement bus service.

139
00:06:38,760 -> 00:06:40,760
Please talk me through the clues, what would those words be?

140
00:06:40,760 -> 00:06:43,440
Retrain, to learn new skills, in clue one.

141
00:06:43,440 -> 00:06:45,560
We have restrain, to hold back.

142
00:06:45,560 -> 00:06:47,400
Contraindication.

143
00:06:47,400 -> 00:06:49,400
That's clever, isn't it? Contrainedication.

144
00:06:49,400 -> 00:06:52,960
And you didn't need to see "Untrained",
not having been taught particular skills.

145
00:06:53,400 -> 00:06:54,200
Well done.

146
00:06:54,800 -> 00:06:56,440
Sorcerers, what's next?

147
00:06:56,440 -> 00:06:57,480
Water, please.

148
00:06:57,480 -> 00:06:59,640
Water. These are gonna be picture clues.

149
00:06:59,640 -> 00:07:01,880
What do they have in common? Here's the first.

150
00:07:03,640 -> 00:07:07,440
A car crash. A serious accident.

151
00:07:07,440 -> 00:07:08,720
Let's do next.

152
00:07:08,720 -> 00:07:09,840
Next.

153
00:07:11,560 -> 00:07:12,680
Tide? Tide pod?

154
00:07:13,240 -> 00:07:14,480
A tab.

155
00:07:14,480 -> 00:07:16,280
The tabs... Power...

156
00:07:16,280 -> 00:07:17,160
Next.

157
00:07:20,240 -> 00:07:22,880
That's The Edge. The Edge from U2.

158
00:07:24,240 -> 00:07:25,120
Next.

159
00:07:31,040 -> 00:07:32,600
A gauntlet.

160
00:07:37,040 -> 00:07:39,040
Keys on a keyboard.

161
00:07:39,040 -> 00:07:40,240
Not it.

162
00:07:40,240 -> 00:07:42,240
Pitchers, another bonus chance.

163
00:07:42,240 -> 00:07:43,640
Are these all lines?

164
00:07:43,640 -> 00:07:45,400
I'm afraid not.

165
00:07:45,400 -> 00:07:49,320
That first clue, it's a still from a TV program called "Collision".

166
00:07:49,320 -> 00:07:53,880
We've got Collision, Powerball, The Edge of course, and Gauntlet.

167
00:07:53,880 -> 00:07:56,360
They are games on Gladiators.

168
00:07:56,360 -> 00:07:58,800
The reincarnated Gladiators show.

169
00:08:01,840 -> 00:08:05,240
Pitchers, there's one choice left. What will it be?

170
00:08:05,240 -> 00:08:07,040
The Lion, please Victoria.

171
00:08:07,040 -> 00:08:10,320
Lion. What do these clues have in common? Here's the first.

172
00:08:12,320 -> 00:08:14,320
Turkey? No, Austrian flag.

173
00:08:14,320 -> 00:08:15,680
Vienna.

174
00:08:15,680 -> 00:08:17,440
Is it capital?

175
00:08:17,440 -> 00:08:19,600
Vienna... Queen of Africa...

176
00:08:19,600 -> 00:08:20,800
Next, please.

177
00:08:22,040 -> 00:08:23,880
Nigeria and outside?

178
00:08:23,880 -> 00:08:26,600
Green... Green something...

179
00:08:26,600 -> 00:08:28,400
Oh, is it Penguin?

180
00:08:28,400 -> 00:08:31,040
It is... Like the Penguin book coloring?

181
00:08:31,040 -> 00:08:33,520
African Penguin, Little Penguin... those are both penguins.

182
00:08:33,520 -> 00:08:34,880
Is it just penguins?

183
00:08:34,880 -> 00:08:36,440
You can bail me out if I get it wrong mate.

184
00:08:38,00:0 -> 00:08:39,120
Penguins.

185
00:08:39,120 -> 00:08:44,480
Um, in so far as African Penguin, Little Penguin,
and these are the color schemes for Penguin Books with those genres.

186
00:08:44,480 -> 00:08:47,720
That is exactly right! And well done,
you get three points for coming in after two clues.

187
00:08:48,320 -> 00:08:52,960
So that first series of Penguin books released...
Originally I think they were black and white...

188
00:08:52,960 -> 00:08:55,760
...but they had a color block to show genre.

189
00:08:55,760 -> 00:08:59,320
We are combining actual penguins with Penguin Books.

190
00:09:00,760 -> 00:09:02,120
Sorcerers, one question left.

191
00:09:02,120 -> 00:09:03,360
The Horned Viper.

192
00:09:03,360 -> 00:09:06,120
What do these clues have in common? Here's the first.

193
00:09:07,880 -> 00:09:09,720
Love perhaps...

194
00:09:10,480 -> 00:09:12,120
Amazing?

195
00:09:14,080 -> 00:09:15,360
Must be nothing.

196
00:09:15,360 -> 00:09:16,280
Next.

197
00:09:17,680 -> 00:09:19,280
Malted milk drink.

198
00:09:19,280 -> 00:09:21,120
Ovaltine?

199
00:09:21,120 -> 00:09:22,360
Horlicks?

200
00:09:22,360 -> 00:09:23,560
Milo?

201
00:09:24,200 -> 00:09:25,120
Next.

202
00:09:27,160 -> 00:09:29,080
Tamagotchi or Neopets?

203
00:09:29,080 -> 00:09:30,120
Tamagotchi.

204
00:09:32,160 -> 00:09:33,800
Is there another virtual pet I don't know?

205
00:09:33,800 -> 00:09:34,720
Next.

206
00:09:36,440 -> 00:09:38,560
Oh, that's the... um...

207
00:09:38,560 -> 00:09:40,560
...the Eames chair? No that's a different one.

208
00:09:42,320 -> 00:09:43,440
Is it egg?

209
00:09:43,440 -> 00:09:44,600
Are they all egg related?

210
00:09:44,600 -> 00:09:45,560
Egg chair?

211
00:09:47,160 -> 00:09:48,960
Related by eggs.

212
00:09:48,960 -> 00:09:51,280
They are connected by eggs.

213
00:09:51,280 -> 00:09:52,960
What can you tell me about the clues?

214
00:09:52,960 -> 00:09:56,360
Love could be zero as in an... an egg?

215
00:09:56,360 -> 00:09:58,040
That's right. People say that...

216
00:09:58,040 -> 00:10:0:0,800
...love in tennis comes from "l'oeuf". We don't know that.

217
00:10:01,800 -> 00:10:05,240
But one of the theories is that it's "l'oeuf",
but also of course that the zero resembles an egg.

218
00:10:05,240 -> 00:10:07,080
What's that second clue?

219
00:10:07,080 -> 00:10:08,800
Ovaltine... we don't know actually.

220
00:10:08,800 -> 00:10:10,080
I mean Ovaltine's an oval.

221
00:10:10,080 -> 00:10:14,240
Well, but it's Ovaltine because of the "ovo", the Latin for egg...

222
00:10:14,240 -> 00:10:16,760
...combined with malt and the other ingredients.

223
00:10:16,760 -> 00:10:18,240
What's the virtual pet?

224
00:10:18,240 -> 00:10:19,160
Tamagotchi.

225
00:10:19,160 -> 00:10:20,520
Tamagotchi.

226
00:10:20,520 -> 00:10:24,800
And "tamago" is the Japanese for egg.
It originally meant "egg watch" because it was a watch.

227
00:10:24,800 -> 00:10:27,280
And the Arne Jacobsen chair, of course, the Egg Chair.

228
00:10:27,280 -> 00:10:28,240
Well done.

229
00:10:28,240 -> 00:10:31,440
That means at the end of Round One, the Sorcerers have 2 points...

230
00:10:31,440 -> 00:10:33,760
...the Pitchers have 6.
